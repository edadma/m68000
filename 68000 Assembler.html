<h2>
<a name="tth_sEc1"></a>1&nbsp; Introduction</h2>
The program described here, 68000 Assembler, is a basic two-pass assembler
for the 68000 and 68010 microprocessors. It supports the complete instruction
set of both processors as well as a modest but capable set of assembler
directives. The program produces formatted listing files as well as object
code files in S-record format.
<p>The program was written in VAX-11 C by Paul McKee during the fall semester,
1986. The program should be portable (with reasonable changes) to any C
language implementation that supports 32-bit integers.
</p><h2>
<a name="tth_sEc2"></a>2&nbsp; Source Code Format</h2>

<h3>
<a name="tth_sEc2.1"></a>2.1&nbsp; Source Line Format</h3>
The input to the assembler is a file containing instructions, assembler
directives, and comments. Each line of the file may be up to 256 characters
long. It is recommended, however, that the source lines be no longer that
80 characters, as this will guarantee that the lines of the listing file
do not exceed 132 characters in length. The assembler treats uppercase
and lowercase identically.
<p>Each line of the source code consists of the following fields:
</p><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LABEL&nbsp;&nbsp; OPERATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OPERAND,OPERAND,...&nbsp;&nbsp; COMMENT

</pre>
For example,
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOVE.L&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A0)+,(A1)+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample source line

</pre>
The fields may be separated by any combination of spaces and tabs. Except
for the comment field and quoted strings, there must be no spaces or tabs
within a field.
<h4>
<a name="tth_sEc2.1.1"></a>2.1.1&nbsp; Label Field</h4>
Legal labels follow the rules for forming symbol names described in section
<a href="#sec22">2.2</a>. Labels may be distinguished in one of two ways:
(1) They may begin in column 1, or (2) they may end in a colon, which does
not become part of the label but simply serves to mark its end. A line
may consist of a label alone. When a label is encountered in the source
code, it is defined to have a value equal to the current location counter.
This symbol may be used elsewhere is the program to refer to that location.
<h4>
<a name="tth_sEc2.1.2"></a>2.1.2&nbsp; Operation Field</h4>
The operation field specifies the instruction that is to be assembled or
the assembler directive that is to be performed. A size code (.B, .W, .L,
or .S) may be appended to the operation code if allowed, to specify Byte,
Word, Long, or Short operations, respectively. The operation field must
not begin in the column 1, because the operation would be confused with
a label.
<h4>
<a name="tth_sEc2.1.3"></a>2.1.3&nbsp; Operand Field</h4>
The operand field may or may not be required, depending on the instruction
or directive being used. If present, the field consists of one or more
comma-separated items with no intervening
<p>spaces or tabs. (There may be spaces or tabs within an item, but only
within quoted strings.)
</p><h4>
<a name="tth_sEc2.1.4"></a>2.1.4&nbsp; Comment Field</h4>
The comment field usually consists of everything on a source line after
the operand field. No special character is needed to introduce the comment,
and it may contain any characters desired.
<p>A comment may also be inserted in the source file in another way: An
asterisk ("*") at the beginning of the line or after the label field will
cause the rest of the line to be ignored, i.e., treated as a comment.
</p><h3>
<a name="tth_sEc2.2"></a>2.2&nbsp; Symbols</h3>
<a name="sec22"></a>
<p>Symbols appear in the source code as labels, constants, and operands.
The first character of a symbol must be either a letter (A-Z) or a period
("."). The remaining characters may be letters, dollar signs ("$"), periods
("."), or underscores("_"). A symbol may be of any length, but only the
first 8 characters are significant. Remember that capitalization is ignored,
so symbols which are capitalized differently are really the same.
</p><h3>
<a name="tth_sEc2.3"></a>2.3&nbsp; Expressions</h3>
An expression may be used in the source program anywhere a number is called
for. An expression consists of one or more operands (numbers or symbols),
combined with unary or binary operators. These components are described
below. The value of the expression and intermediate values are always computed
to 32 bits, with no account being made of any overflow that may occur.
(Division by zero, however, will cause an error.)
<h4>
<a name="tth_sEc2.3.1"></a>2.3.1&nbsp; Operands in Expressions</h4>
An operand in an expression is either a symbol or one of the following
sorts of constants.
<p><b>Decimal Numbers</b>
</p><p>A decimal number consists of a sequence of decimal digits (0-9) of any
length. A warning will be generated if the value of the number cannot be
represented in 32 bits.
</p><p><b>Hexadecimal Numbers</b>
</p><p>A hexadecimal number consists of a dollar sign ("$") followed by a sequence
of hexadecimal digits (0-9 and A-F) of any
</p><p>length. A warning will be generated if the value of the number cannot
be represented in 32 bits.
</p><p><b>Binary Numbers</b>
</p><p>A binary number consists of a percent sign ("%") followed by a sequence
of binary digits (0 and 1) of any length. A warning will be generated if
the number consists of more that 32 digits.
</p><p><b>Octal Numbers</b>
</p><p>An octal number consists of a commercial at sign ("<tt>@</tt>") followed
by a sequence of octal digits (0-7) of any length. A warning will be generated
if the value of the number cannot be represented in 32 bits.
</p><p><b>ASCII Constants</b>
</p><p>An ASCII constant consists of one to four ASCII characters enclosed
in single quote marks. If it is desired to put a single quote mark inside
an ASCII constant, then two consecutive single quotes may be used to represent
one such character.
</p><p>If the ASCII constant consists of one character, then it will be placed
in the bottom byte of the 32 bit value; two characters will be placed in
the bottom word, with the first character in the higher-order position.
If four characters are used, then all four bytes will contain characters,
with the first in the highest-order location. However, if three characters
are used, then they will be placed in the three highest-order bytes of
the 32-bit value, with 0 in the low byte (this is to accommodate the high-byte-first
addressing used on the 68000).
</p><p>Note that ASCII constants in expressions are different from strings
in DC directives, as the latter may be of any length.
</p><h4>
<a name="tth_sEc2.3.2"></a>2.3.2&nbsp; Operators in Expressions</h4>
The operators allowed in expressions are shown in the following table,
in order of decreasing precedence. Within each group, the operators are
evaluated in left-to-right order (except for group 2, which is evaluated
right-to-left).

<h2>
<a name="tth_sEc3"></a>3&nbsp; Assembly Details</h2>

<h3>
<a name="tth_sEc3.1"></a>3.1&nbsp; Branch Instructions</h3>
The branch instructions (Bcc, BRA, and BSR) are unique in that they can
take a ".S" size code. This suffix directs the assembler to assemble these
as short branch instructions, i.e., one-word instructions with a range
to -128 to +127 bytes. If the ".S" size code is used, and the destination
is actually outside this range, then the assembler will print an error
message. If the ".L" size code is used, the assembler will use a long branch,
which is a two-word instruction with a range of -32768 to +32767 bytes.
If neither size code is specified, then the assembler will use a short
branch if possible (the branch destination must be known on the first pass
to be within the short branch range); otherwise it will use long branch.
<h3>
<a name="tth_sEc3.2"></a>3.2&nbsp; MOVEM Instruction</h3>
The MOVEM instruction, which is used for saving and restoring sets of registers,
has one the following two forms:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOVEM&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;register_list&gt;,&lt;effective_address&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOVEM&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;effective_address&gt;,&lt;register_list&gt;

</pre>
The register list may be an explicit register list of the form described
in Section 4.2.3. On the other hand, if a particular set of registers is
to be saved and restored repeatedly, the REG directive (Section 4.2.3)
can be used to define a register list symbol that specifies the registers.
For example, if the register list symbol WORKSET is defined as follows:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WORKSET&nbsp; REG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A0-A4/D1/D2

</pre>
then the following instructions will perform the same function:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOVEM.L&nbsp; WORKSET,-(SP)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOVEM.L&nbsp; A0-A4/D1/D2,-(SP)

</pre>
If a register list symbol is used, it must be defined before it appears
in any MOVEM instructions.
<h3>
<a name="tth_sEc3.3"></a>3.3&nbsp; Quick Instructions (MOVEQ, ADDQ, SUBQ)</h3>
The MOVE, ADD, and SUB instructions have one-word "quick" variations which
can be used certain addressing modes and operand values. The assembler
will use these faster variations automatically when possible, or they may
be specified explicitly by writing the mnemonic as MOVEQ, ADDQ, or SUBQ.
<p>The MOVEQ instruction may be used for moving an immediate value in the
range -128 to +127 into a data register. The assembler will assemble a
MOVE.L #&lt;value&gt;,Dn as a MOVEQ if the value is known on the first pass.
</p><p>The ADDQ (SUBQ) instruction adds (subtracts) an immediate value from
1 to 8 to (from) any alterable destination. The assembler will use the
quick form if the value is known on the first pass to be in the range 1
to 8.
</p><h2>
<a name="tth_sEc4"></a>4&nbsp; Assembler Directives</h2>

<h3>
<a name="tth_sEc4.1"></a>4.1&nbsp; ORG - Set Origin</h3>
The assembler maintains a 32-bit location counter, whose value is initially
zero and which is incremented by some amount whenever an instruction is
assembled or a data storage directive is carried out. The value of this
location counter may be set with the ORG directive. This is typically done
at the start of a program and at appropriate places within it. The format
of the ORG directive is
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;label&gt; ORG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;expression&gt;

</pre>
where &lt;expression&gt; is an expression containing no forward references,
i.e., its value must be known on the first pass at the point where the
ORG directive appears. An error will result if an attempt is made to set
the location counter to an odd value; in this case the location counter
will be set to the specified value plus one. The &lt;label&gt; is optional
and, if present, the specified symbol will be set to the new value of the
location counter.
<h3>
<a name="tth_sEc4.2"></a>4.2&nbsp; Symbol Definition Directives</h3>

<h4>
<a name="tth_sEc4.2.1"></a>4.2.1&nbsp; EQU - Equate Symbol</h4>
The equate directive is used to define symbols whose value will not change
within the program. The format of this directive is
<pre>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;label&gt; EQU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;expression&gt;

</pre>
where &lt;expression&gt; is an expression containing no forward refer ences,
i.e., its value must be known on the first pass at the point where the
EQU directive appears. The &lt;label&gt; must be specified, since it tells
what symbol is being defined. If &lt;label&gt; is omitted, an error will result.
If an attempt is made to redefine a symbol that was defined with EQU, either
as a label or using any symbol definition directive, an error message will
be printed.
<h4>
<a name="tth_sEc4.2.2"></a>4.2.2&nbsp; SET - Set Symbol</h4>
The SET directive is similar in function and format to the equate directive,
with one important difference: symbols defined using SET may be redefined
later using another SET directive (but not using a EQU or REG directive).
The format of this directive is
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;label&gt; SET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;expression&gt;

</pre>

<h4>
<a name="tth_sEc4.2.3"></a>4.2.3&nbsp; REG - Register Range</h4>
Register ranges consist of lists of registers separated by slashes ("/").
Each register range may be either a single register (Än" or "Dn")
or a range of registers (Än-Am" or "Dn-Dm"), which denotes all the
registers between the two registers listed (they may be given in either
order). For example, the following register list specifies that D0, D1,
D2, D3, D7, A1, A2, and A3 are to be saved (or restored):
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D3-D0/D7/A1-A3

</pre>
The registers and ranges may be specified in any order. The same format
for register lists may be used with the MOVEM instruction directly. In
order to avoid confusion, it is best to avoid specifying a range that includes
both an address register and a data register, although the assembler will
not treat this as an error.
<h3>
<a name="tth_sEc4.3"></a>4.3&nbsp; Data Storage Directives</h3>

<h4>
<a name="tth_sEc4.3.1"></a>4.3.1&nbsp; DC - Define Constant</h4>
The define constant directive is used to store strings and lists of constants
in memory. The format of a DC directive is
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;label&gt; DC.&lt;size&gt;&nbsp; &lt;item&gt;,&lt;item&gt;,...

</pre>
The label will be defined to equal the address of the start of the list
of data. The size code specifies that a list of bytes (.B), words (.W),
or longwords (.L) is being defined; if omitted, word size is used.
<p>A list of items follows the directive; each item may be an expression
or a string. If an item is an expression, the expres sion is evaluated
and stored as the size indicated, i.e., a byte, a word, or a longword.
An error is generated if the value will not fit as either a signed or unsigned
value in the specified size. If an item is a string, delimited by single
quotes, then the string will be stored in successive entities of the size
specified; if words or longwords are being generated, and the string does
not fit into an whole number of words or longwords, then the string will
be padded with zeros at the end to make a
</p><p>whole number of words or longwords. Strings and expressions may intermixed
in a single DC directive.
</p><p>If words (DC.W) or longwords (DC.L) are being generated, then the start
of the list of constants will be aligned on a word boundary by increasing
the location counter by one, if necessary. This is not performed for DC.B
directives, so that strings of bytes may be contiguous in memory. If an
instruction follows a DC.B directive, the assembler will automatically
adjust the location counter (if necessary) to place the instruction on
a word boundary.
</p><p>An example of a DC directive that defines a null-terminated string:
</p><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TEXT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'DC Example',$0D,$0A,0

</pre>
This directive results in the following data at location TEXT:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 44 43 20 45 78 61 6D 70 6C 65 0D 0A 00&nbsp; (hexadecimal)

</pre>

<h4>
<a name="tth_sEc4.3.2"></a>4.3.2&nbsp; DCB - Define Constant Block</h4>
The define constant block directive generates a block of bytes, words,
or longwords that are all initialized to the same value by the assembler.
The format of the directive is
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;label&gt;&nbsp; DCB.&lt;size&gt;&nbsp; &lt;length&gt;,&lt;value&gt;

</pre>
The label will be defined to equal the address of the start of the block.
The size code specifies that a block of bytes (.B), words (.W), or longwords
(.L) is being set up; if omitted, word size is used.
<p>The length argument is an expression that tells the number of bytes,
words, or longwords that are to be in the block. This value must be known
on the first pass at the point where the DCB directive appears, and it
must be non-negative. The value argument is an expression whose value is
to be placed in each data item in the block; it needn't be known on the
first pass. An warning message will be printed if the value will not fit
(as a signed or unsigned number) in the data size selected.
</p><p>If word or longword size is selected, then the start of the block will
be placed on a word boundary by increasing the location counter by one,
if necessary. If an instruction follows a DCB.B directive, the assembler
will automatically adjust the location counter (if necessary) to place
the instruction on a word boundary.
</p><h4>
<a name="tth_sEc4.3.3"></a>4.3.3&nbsp; DS - Define Storage</h4>
The define storage directive generates an uninitialized
<p>block of bytes, words, or longwords. The format of the directive is
</p><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;label&gt;&nbsp; DS.&lt;size&gt;&nbsp; &lt;length&gt;

</pre>
The label will be defined to equal the address of the start of the block.
The size code specifies that a block of bytes (.B), words (.W), or longwords
(.L) is being set up; if omitted, word size is used.
<p>The length argument is an expression that tells the number of bytes,
words, or longwords that are to be in the block. This value must be known
on the first pass at the point where the DCB directive appears, and it
must be non-negative. The effect of the DS directive is basically to increase
the value of the location counter by &lt;length&gt; times one (if DS.B is
used), two (if DS.W is used), or four (if DS.L is used)
</p><p>If word or longword size is selected, then the start of the block will
be placed on a word boundary by increasing the loca tion counter by one,
if necessary. Thus, DS.W 0 can be used to force the location counter to
be aligned on a word boundary without allocating any space. However, if
an instruction follows a DS.B directive, the assembler will automatically
adjust the location counter (if necessary) to align the instruction on
a word boundary.
</p><h3>
<a name="tth_sEc4.4"></a>4.4&nbsp; END - End of Source File</h3>
The end directive is used to mark the end of the source file. It is purely
optional. The format is simply
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END

</pre>
The assembler will ignore anything in the source file after the END directive.
<h2>
<a name="tth_sEc5"></a>5&nbsp; Usage</h2>

<h3>
<a name="tth_sEc5.1"></a>5.1&nbsp; Command Line</h3>
The 68000 Assembler is run by typing a command line of the following form:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASM &lt;options&gt; &lt;filename&gt;

</pre>
The options are a string of letters, preceded by a dash, which alter the
behavior of the assembler. The following option letters are allowed:
<center><table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>C&nbsp;</td>

<td align="CENTER">=</td>

<td>Show all the Constants produced by DC directives&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>

<td align="CENTER"></td>

<td>(see Section <a href="#sec52">5.2</a>)&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>L&nbsp;</td>

<td align="CENTER">=</td>

<td>Produce a Listing file&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>N&nbsp;</td>

<td align="CENTER">=</td>

<td>Produce No object code file&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table></center>
If these options are not specified, the defaults are to show only one line
of data from a DC directive, to produce no listing, and to produce an object
file.
<p>The filename is the name, including directory specifica tions, of the
file to be assembled. No default file extension is applied. The names of
the listing and object code files, if generated, are constructed by using
the source file name with an extension of ".LIS" (for the listing) or ".H68"
(for the object file); the output files are always placed in the user's
default directory.
</p><p>The program will print "68000 Assembler by PGM" when it begins work.
If any errors occur, the program will print ËRROR in line X" or "WARNING
in line X" (this information is also placed in the listing file). Upon
conclusion, it will print the number of errors encountered and warnings
generated during the assembly.
</p><p>If there is an error in the command line, e.g., if no file name is specified,
then the assembler will print a brief usage summary and abort.
</p><h3>
<a name="tth_sEc5.2"></a>5.2&nbsp; Listing File Format</h3>
<a name="sec52"></a>
<p>The assembler produces a listing file which shows the source code alongside
the the object code produced by the assembler. A typical listing file line
might appear as follows (not to scale):
</p><pre>&nbsp; 0000102E&nbsp; 22D8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 200&nbsp; LOOP&nbsp; MOVE.L (A0)+,(A1)+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample

</pre>
The eight digit hexadecimal number at the left is the assembler's location
counter; the generated instruction word, $22D8, is placed at that address.
The next number is the source file line number, and the remainder of the
line simply repeats the source line. Remember that if the source lines
are no longer than 80 columns, then the listing file lines will not exceed
132 columns.
<p>If an error is encountered or a warning is generated for a given source
line, then in the listing that line will be followed by a line that describes
the error. At the end of the listing, the program prints the total number
of errors and warnings.
</p><p>There is only limited space to list the object code in this format.
There is sufficient space for the longest possible instruction, but the
DC directive poses a problem, since it may generate, e.g., dozens of longwords
from a single source line. The assembler's -C command line option controls
the assembler's actions when the object code exceeds the space available
on one line. If -C is not specified, then the assembler will print only
one listing line with an ellipsis ("...") at the end of the object code
field, indicating that some of the data produced by the directive was omitted
from the listing. If -C is included on the command line, then the assembler
will use as many source lines as are needed to print all the data produced
by the directive. Each line after the first will contain only the location
counter and the object code field (the source line is not repeated).
</p><h3>
<a name="tth_sEc5.3"></a>5.3&nbsp; Object Code File Format</h3>
The 68000 Assembler produces an object code output file in S-record format.
The object file name is the source file name, with the extension changed
to ".H68". The object file and the listing file are always placed in the
user's default directory.
<p>The S-record format is designed to allow files containing any data to
be interchanged in text file format with checksum error detection. The
format of these files will not be described here, but the following technical
information will be provided: The first line of the object file is an S0
(header) record and the last line is an S9 (termination) record. The lines
in between are S1, S2, or S3 records, depending on the whether the address
of the first byte in a record requires 2, 3, or 4 bytes to be represented.
No record is longer than 80 characters.
